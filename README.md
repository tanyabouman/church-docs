# Church Documents

**Warning**: if using a file manager and opening pdfs on your phone is too difficult,
please try apps instead:
- [Android Psalter app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrvermeer.psalter)
- [iOS Psalter app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-psalter-1912/id1139689141)
- Psalmboek.nl apps: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.wimbokkers.psalmen) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/psalmboek-nl/id594145882)

These are a few church-related documents that I keep on my phone.
I originally needed them because I had a Windows phone and no Psalter apps were
available, but I keep using them because I want the
[Grotenhuis transcriptions](https://digitalcollections.dordt.edu/grotenhuis_keyboard/342/)
on mobile.
The documents are all split into smaller pieces and then into separate folders because my
phone wasn't fast enough to deal with large pdfs or long lists of files.
I haven't checked whether my current phone can handle that.
